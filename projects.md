### Python
We've been experimenting with vision processing with our FRC robots. Now that we're on our 3rd year with FRC, we've got a couple robots but not enough controllers. The actual RoboRIO controllers are quite expensive so we've been looking for an alternative. We settled on [RobotOpen](http://www.team221.com/robotopen/gs.html) since it's built in a similar fashion and terminology to the FRC software. Plus it's open source so we can tailor it to our needs. The first thing is we want to run [Raspberry Pi's](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). This presents a problem since the RobotOpen libraries are for Arduino so we started porting them to [Python](https://github.com/jmassardo/RobotOpen-RP3-Python-Library).

### OpenCV
OpenCV is the main library used for FRC vision processing. We're still in the early stages of learning so I don't have much right now. We're primarily using [GRIP](http://wpiroboticsprojects.github.io/GRIP/#/) with a little manual tweaking.
