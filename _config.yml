# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Site configuration for the Jekyll 3 Pagination Plugin
# The values here represent the defaults if nothing is set
pagination:

  # Site-wide kill switch, disabled here it doesn't run at all 
  enabled: true

  # How many objects per paginated page, used to be `paginate` (default: 0, means all)
  per_page: 5

  # The permalink structure for the paginated pages (this can be any level deep)
  permalink: '/page/:num/'

  # Optional additional suffix for the title of the paginated pages (the prefix is inherited from the template page)
  title_suffix: ' - page :num'

  # Limit how many pagenated pages to create (default: 0, means all)
  limit: 0

  # Optional, defines the field that the posts should be sorted on (omit to default to 'date')
  sort_field: 'date'

  # Optional, sorts the posts in reverse order (omit to default decending or sort_reverse: true)
  sort_reverse: true

  # The default category to use, just leave this as 'posts' to get a backwards-compatible behavior (all posts)
  category: 'posts'

  # Optional, the default tag to use, omit to disable
  tag: 'cool'

  # Optional, the default locale to use, omit to disable (depends on a field 'locale' to be specified in the posts, 
  # in reality this can be any value, suggested are the Microsoft locale-codes (e.g. en_US, en_GB) or simply the ISO-639 language code )
  locale: 'en_US'
