I met a lot of really awesome people at ChefConf. One guy, named Daniel, and I were joking about blogging stuff and we said we should start a blog named Dear Future Self. Technologists come in contact with so much information, there's no way anyone can remember it all. A lot of the stuff on this blog is literally so I don't have to remember everything.

So Dear Future self, please enjoy all this stuff :)
