# Welcome

This is the Github project for my personal website.

I'm using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> with a customized theme from <a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/">lanyon</a>. The site is hosted with GitHub Pages. You might notice that I have multiple domain names pointed to the same pages site, [this](https://dxrf.com/blog/2021/02/22/multiple-domain-redirect-github-pages/) is how I make that work with Pages.
